    <h1>D'Angelo Mays</h1>
    <p>My name is D'Angelo Bernard Mays, I am 16 years old and heading into my Senior year of highschool. Outside of school clubs and activites, I really like gaming, art, music and volleyball! In terms of my career I really want to land a job in some type of Computer Science, my main few options that I've looked at are Cybersecurity, Software Development, Graphic Design, Game Design etc.. A lot of the Computer Science options peak my interest a little bit, it's just a matter of me deciding now.</p>
